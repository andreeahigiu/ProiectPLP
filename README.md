# ProiectPLP
This is a project for Programming Languages Principles
It consists of an original programming language created using imp language in Coq Proof Assistant. It has a part of syntax which represents the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language and a part of semantics which evaluates the meaning of syntactically correct pieces of code.
